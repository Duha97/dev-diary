Hello, my name is **Duha** and I am a new *software engineer* (Introduction)

## Here is what I learned from the good developer mindset

 1.A successful developer must adopt a lifelong learning mindset to keep up with evolving technologies.
 2.Large problems should be broken into smaller, manageable tasks for better clarity and progress.
 3.Debugging requires critical thinking and detective-like investigation, not assumptions.
 4.A growth mindset helps you overcome challenges and view failure as a learning opportunity.
 5.Code should always focus on delivering value to users, not just elegance or complexity.
 6.Simplicity and maintainability in design and implementation are key to long-term success.
 7.Developers must make smart trade-offs and prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency.
 8.Plan for future maintenance and extensibility, not just short-term functionality.
 9.Embrace iterative development and continuous user feedback over perfect planning.
 10.Automate repetitive tasks and avoid perfectionism _good enough_‚Äù_ shipped is better than perfect never released.
